# instagram_followers

This code gets you the difference between two sets of followers.

#### This code allows you to:
- Know who you are following you and if they do not follow you.
- Know who follows you and you are not following.

#### How to use it?
  1. Go to the instagram profile you want, in this example we used _PSG_ account.

  2. Open the developer tools, elements and copy the body.
  3. Paste it on Followers.txt
  4. To the same for Following.txt
  5. In the _main_ function change write_to_file if you want the difference from _A to B_ or _B to A_.
